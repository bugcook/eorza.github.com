excerpt: 跟朋友去买手机，在一个小店了听到这首歌，感觉特别的熟悉，回家后到网上查了一下，才发现，原来我两部最喜欢的电影都是以它作为插曲的。《阿甘正传》，《重庆森林》。

跟朋友去买手机，在一个小店了听到这首歌，感觉特别的熟悉，回家后到网上查了一下，才发现，原来我两部最喜欢的电影都是以它作为插曲的。《阿甘正传》，《重庆森林》。

> All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray.

> I've been for a walk on a winter's day.

> I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.;

> California dreamin? on such a winter's day.

> Stopped in to a church I passed along the way.

> Well I got down on my knees and I pretend to pray.

> You know the preacher liked the cold;

> He knows I'm gonna stay.

> California dreamin? on such a winter's day.

> All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray.

> I've been for a walk on a winter's day.

> If I didn't tell her I could leave today;

> California dreamin? on such a winter's day.

> California dreamin? on such a winter's day.

> California dreamin? on such a winter's day.
